# CodePop Requirements Document

## Introduction

### Overview of CodePop

CodePop is an innovative beverage application that leverages advanced technology, including AI and automation, to redefine the customer experience in soda customization and ordering. Designed to function seamlessly across multiple platforms, including handheld devices and desktops, CodePop aims to provide users with a unique and efficient way to create, customize, and order their favorite drinks. The application is geared towards minimal human intervention, utilizing AI and automated systems to manage inventory, process orders, and provide customer support.

### Purpose of Requirements Document

The purpose of this requirements document is to provide a comprehensive outline for the functionality of the CodePop software. This document serves to keep developers and stakeholders on the same page in regards to basic requirements of CodePop going forward. 

### Introduction to MoSCoW Analysis

To effectively prioritize the requirements for this application, we will use MoSCoW analysis. This method categorizes requirements into four groups:

- **Must Have *(M)*:** Essential features needed for the application to function correctly.
- **Should Have *(S)*:** Important but not critical features that enhance user experience.
- **Could Have *(C)*S:** Desirable features that are not essential but could add value to the application.
- **Won’t Have *(W)*:** Features that are not relevant or feasible at this stage.

In this document, these categories will be indicated with the following abbreviations added to each requirement for clarity:
- **M** for Must Have
- **S** for Should Have
- **C** for Could Have
- **W** for Won’t Have

These abbreviations will facilitate a clear and efficient understanding of the priority and scope of each requirement.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Device Accessibility:**
*(M)* Prioritize functionality for handheld devices, specifically phones. CodePop should function as both an app and a site, and work on both iphone and android. The site will work on the most up to date versions of more popular search browsers, like Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

**Ability to Sign Up and Sign In:**
*(M)* A variety of users can sign into the app/website, including Admins, Users, and Managers. Users with an account can save preferences and favorites, managers can see inventory, complaints, and revenue/payments, and admins can have access to user data and accounts (ex. remove problematic accounts or add a manager account). Users can use CodePop without an account, but their information (favorites and preferences) will not get saved.

*(S)* New users signing up will be given a brief tutorial to get them familiar with the CodePop interface and how to use it.

**Ordering and AI Integration:**
There are three different ways to order sodas on CodePop:

- **Manual Creation and Customization:** *(M)* The user will be given a layered interface to choose their soda flavor, how much ice they want (ex. light, medium, heavy), syrup flavor and how many pumps they want in their drink, and the flavor of cream and how much (ex. light, medium, heavy). Items can be excluded, such as if the user does not want any cream in their soda.


- **AI Randomized Soda:** *(M)* An AI will create a soda for the user using a random combination of soda flavor, ice amount, syrup flavor and pumps, and cream. The user can review the drink and, if it does not sound good, they can re-randomize and the AI will create a new drink.

  If the user has an account with CodePop, the user can choose to have the AI randomize based on their preferences: leaving out flavors they do not like and including flavors they do. Users without an account will not get this option, but they will get text in place of the “personalized-randomize” button that says they can get more personalized creations via account creation. General Users can get randomized drinks based on popular flavors as a placeholder.


- **Preset Menu and Seasonal Drinks:** *(C)* If the user wants to order a non-randomized, preset drink, there will be a menu with a variety of drinks the user can pick from. This menu will also include a seasonal section, with different sodas swapping out throughout the year (flavors of in-season fruits and drinks for special events).

- For all options, the user can order multiple sodas, remove, review, and edit sodas in the cart, or cancel before they make a payment.

**Payment:** *(M)*
The user will pay for their soda(s) as soon as they submit their order either on the app or the website. If the cart is empty no transactions will take place. If the user decides to cancel the order, they will get immediately reimbursed. The user should not be able to cancel their order once the drinks have been picked up. To prevent theft, the user is given an order code after payment that they can input into their cooler at the location.  *(C)* There will also be an option to save credit/debit card or payment methods for future use.

**Geolocation and AI:**
*(M)* After submitting and paying for an order, the app will ask for the user’s location. Different options will be available depending on the user’s answer:
  - **Yes:** An AI will track how fast the user is approaching and how much time the order will take to assemble. Using both of these, the AI will determine how close the user needs to be to the CodePop location before the robots begin making the order. If user location is for some reason unavailable, the user will be notified and will only be given the “start” button (see below). If the user does not want the drinks to start creation based on distance, they will have a “start” button to press when they are ready to head to the location. The user will get to know how long their order will take so they can press the “start” option at the right time.

  - **No:** The user will be able to start the order by pushing a button. The user will get to see how long their order should take, that way they can start the order at the right time.

  - Scheduling the drinks to be ready at a certain time is also an option.

**Inventory Tracking and AI:**
*(M)* To prevent a CodePop location from running out of ingredients, an AI will keep track of how popular certain ingredients are (in the CodePop store) and the rate at which they are being used. When an ingredient is estimated to start running low based on current usage trends (in store only), the AI will notify the manager to order more of it.

**AI Usage:**
*(M)* AI is an integral part of the app/website’s functionality and is used in a variety of places:
  - **Randomly Generated Drinks:** When prompted, the AI will create a randomized drink for the user. This can either use the user’s preferences to create the drink or do something completely random. If the user does not like what the AI creates, they can have the AI re-randomize a new drink.

  - **Geolocation and EST:** The AI will use geolocation to keep track of the user. Using a combination of the user’s rate of speed and an estimation of how long the soda order will take to create, the AI determines how close the user needs to be to the CodePop location before the robots start creating their order.

  - **Inventory Tracking:** The AI will keep track of ingredient popularity and the rate at which ingredients are being used (in store). When it predicts an ingredient to start running low, it will notify the manager what ingredients should be ordered and restocked.

**Maintainability:**
*(M)* The codebase must be modular, well-documented, and adhere to established coding standards to facilitate ease of maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting. This includes clear comments, structured code, and comprehensive documentation. Additionally, all dependencies, libraries, and frameworks used in the application should be kept up-to-date to ensure security, compatibility, and optimal performance.

**Accessible:**
*(S)* The application must comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 to ensure that users with disabilities can navigate and use the application effectively. This includes avoiding problematic color combinations, such as red and green, and providing alternative text labels for color-based indicators.

**Reporting:**
*(S)* The system should include features for inventory management. It must automatically notify the manager when items are out of stock and generate detailed reports that can be sent to the developer for further analysis. Additionally, the system should provide the manager with financial reports, offering insights into revenue. This will ensure timely restocking, help in identifying inventory trends or potential issues, and provide a clear understanding of the store's financial performance
