## System architecture

Client-server architecture

The CodePop system architecture follows a three-tier model, consisting of the front-end, middle-end, and back-end layers. The front-end, built with React Native, handles user interaction and interfaces, communicating with the middle-end via API requests. The middle-end is powered by Django, acting as the central framework that manages business logic, authentication, and data flow. It interacts with the PostgreSQL database on the back-end, which stores user data, drink configurations, and order information. APIs like Stripe (for payments), MapBox (for geolocation), and AI-based models (for drink generation and complaints chatbot) are integrated to enhance functionality and user experience, ensuring seamless interaction between the client and server.

## User interfaces:

### Accessibility

The CodePop interface is carefully designed to support both usability and accessibility, adhering to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). A color palette has been selected based on an analysis of common forms of color blindness, ensuring that problematic combinations like teal and purple are not placed next to each other for better readability. Each page is fully compatible with screen readers, offering audio feedback for users with visual impairments. Additionally, tab-controlled navigation is integrated, allowing keyboard users to easily move through the interface without relying on a mouse, ensuring a more inclusive user experience.

## System performance

To address system performance, potential bottlenecks such as high traffic during peak hours, concurrent payment processing, and large database queries are considered. The system is designed with scalability in mind, using load balancing techniques to distribute traffic across multiple server instances. The use of a CDN for static assets ensures faster content delivery to users across different regions. For the backend, Django’s ORM optimizes database queries, and indexing will be employed for frequently accessed data like user preferences and drink details to improve response times. PostgreSQL will handle database connections efficiently, but if demand grows, database read replicas will be deployed to reduce the load on the primary database. Additionally, autoscaling for cloud infrastructure ensures that more server instances can be automatically provisioned during traffic spikes. This architecture allows the system to handle increases in load while maintaining optimal performance.

## Security risks

The CodePop app incorporates a robust security model based on Django’s built-in authentication and authorization system. This system manages user accounts, groups, permissions, and cookie-based sessions, ensuring secure access across different user roles. Admins have the authority to manage user accounts, add or remove users, and create manager accounts, while managers have access to store-specific data like revenue and expense reports. To enhance security, features such as password strength checking can be implemented. The app separates the client and server, utilizing token-based authentication for secure communication. Django’s security features include query parameterization for injection protection and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection to prevent unauthorized actions. Additionally, sensitive data, including user payment information, email addresses, and store revenue reports, will be encrypted using SHA-256 both at rest and in transit. CodePop complies with relevant data protection laws such as GDPR and takes measures to address the OWASP Top 10 security risks. Users will be given the option to opt into features that handle personal data, ensuring transparency and privacy.

* **Authentication and Authorization**: Description of user roles and permission management.  
  * Explanation of admin and manager access and roles:  
    * Admins have access to user account information as well as permissions to add/remove general user accounts and create manager accounts.   
    * Managers have access to store data such as revenue and expense reports.   
  * Django comes with a built in user authentication system that handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions  
    * This system can be expanded and customized to add things like   
    * password strength checking to add more security.    
  * To secure the application, the client and server will be separated.   
    * The client and server will talk to each other through token authentication which is already included with Django.   
  * Django security features: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/security/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/security/)  
    * Includes injection protection because queries are constructed using query parameterization  
    * Includes Cross site request forgery (CSRF) protection which prevents attacks that perform actions using other people’s credentials.  
* **Data Encryption**: Explanation of how data will be encrypted (at rest and in transit).  
  * Django user data encryption  
  * Sha 256 encryption  
* **Compliance**: Relevant data protection laws (GDPR, HIPAA).  
  * Pay attention to the OWASP top 10: [https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)  
* **Sensitive data**  
  * User data:  
    * Payment information  
    * Email  
    * geolocation  
  * Store data:  
    * Revenue reports  
* **Privacy**  
  * We will make sure that the user has the option to opt into any of the features that handle personal data (geolocation, drink preferences, emails) to ensure that they are able to make an informed choice about their data.

* **Hosting**:  
  * **Frontend Hosting**: Deploy frontend assets to a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast global access (e.g., AWS S3 or Netlify).  
  * **Backend Hosting**: Use cloud-based services like AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean for running the Django app.  
* **Database Setup**: Deploy the PostgreSQL database using cloud-based solutions (e.g., AWS RDS or Heroku Postgres) for scalability and backup.  
* **Security Setup**:  
  * **SSL/TLS Certificates**: Ensure HTTPS is enabled for secure communication.  
  * **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data like API keys and database credentials securely (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).  
  * **Firewall & Access Control**: Set up firewalls and limit access to production servers using SSH keys.  
  * **Backup Plan**: Regular backups of databases and critical assets to prevent data loss.

**5\. Production Deployment**

* **Code Freeze**: Set a code freeze date before deployment to ensure no last-minute changes.  
* **Final Deployment Steps**:  
  * Deploy the frontend and backend to their respective hosting services.  
  * Migrate any production databases and ensure all data from staging is migrated.  
  * Ensure that token-based authentication and secure data encryption (e.g., SHA-256) are fully operational.  
* **Post-Deployment Validation**:  
  * Test all critical functions (sign-in, drink creation, cart, payment).  
  * Check that the admin and manager dashboards are accessible with the correct permissions.

**6\. Post-Deployment Monitoring & Maintenance**

* **Ongoing Monitoring**: Ensure performance metrics are actively tracked, especially during high traffic periods.  
* **Bug Fixes**: Implement a process for quickly addressing user-reported issues or security vulnerabilities.  
* **Regular Updates**: Schedule periodic security patches, updates to libraries, and infrastructure improvements.

**7\. Scaling & Future Enhancements**

* **Auto-Scaling**: Set up auto-scaling for cloud-based infrastructure to handle growing user demand.  
* **Feature Rollouts**: Plan for iterative feature deployment, such as enhanced AI drink recommendations or more detailed analytics for managers and admins.  
* **Performance Optimization**: Regularly review the system’s performance and optimize database queries, asset loading times, and server response times.
